        <!-- What is jQuery? -->

    <!-- Ans : 
        
        -> jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

        -> The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

        -> jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
